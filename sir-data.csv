"So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great?",,
"And the Army coach, who's a great guy ... all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong.

The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy.

So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, ""What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,"" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money.

"I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, ""Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land."" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, ""Sir, they can't produce that much."" I said, ""Forget it."" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration.",,

She loves me again. She didn't love me before, sir. She loves me again."" That tells you something about money, doesn't it?",,
"Probably the number one reason I ran for office. I'm one for one. I have friends. Some of these great senators, look at Lindsey over there and look at Rand. These great senators. Sure, I've run five times and I've won three. And other senators said ""Sir, I've won seven times, sir."" Southern senator. ""I won seven times, sir, and I've won five of those damn contests."" I said, ""Senator, I ran once and I won just once."" And we're going to run twice and that's going to be it. Although they think we're going to run much more than that, you know that, right?

Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike.

It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill.

Because look, let's face it, China is 1.4 billion people, we're 325, not including illegal immigrants that are in the country, frankly. And we don't even know what that number... I said, ""How many do we have?"" ""We have no idea, sir."" Well, I have an idea... By the way, our Southern border is now stronger than it's ever been. But we have 325, 330 million people.

And when they targeted Iowa and the farmers of this country, and ranchers, and others, I said, ""No, you can't do that, no, you can't."" And I put a 25% tariff on everything and I gave a lot of the money... I don't want to say it too loudly, 28 billion, I gave you 16 and 12.

Frankly, you did better without even working, if you want to know the truth. Came from China and we did a hell of a job and those farmers are all happy today, but they were targeted by China. We got $28 billion in tariffs and we gave it to your farmers and everybody's doing just fine today, right?

We're a backup. We're not an ordering clerk. We're a back up and we've done an unbelievable job. Like for instance, whoever heard of a governor calling up, "" Sir, can you build us a hospital of 2,500 rooms?"" And we built it. ""Can you build us four medical centers?"" We built it. ""Can you deliver a ship, a hospital ship with a thousand rooms?"" And we did it and we did it in Los Angeles, too. We've been unbelief. We've done an unbelievable job...

"You heard the case where thousands of ventilators could have been had at a very inexpensive price three years ago and a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it's big money. You're talking about, I think it was $1 billion, but you're talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen. Because normally on a ventilator other than a pandemic or an epidemic, you wouldn't need anything like this. Hospitals have three ventilators, big hospitals, and they get by with it. And now they want thousands. I mean they want thousands of ventilators. You call up a governor and they'll say, ""Sir, could you send us 40,000 ventilators?""

"And remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. They can say what they want. This FBI agent has just now, first one, admitted. That's the beginning, hopefully, of the falling castle. But he's admitted that he forged documents. He changed documents, reversing them, and he admitted it. So let's see what's going to happen over the next, hopefully, short period of time. Because it's been unfair that we've had to wait so long. That was so obvious for a long time, and it should never be allowed to happen to another president again. That I can tell you. And that's for the good of the country. Not for me, for the good of the country. Within three years, we replaced NAFTA, which everybody said was impossible to do, with a brand new and really pro-America USMCA. It's a whole different ball game. And we don't want to lose our companies to Mexico and Canada. And this puts a tremendous price tag on doing that. If they want to do that, they won't be doing that. In everything we do, my administration is fighting for the American people and delivering one victory after another. We have appointed more than 230 federal judges. We expect to be perhaps over 300 federal judges by the end of the year. Thank you. I can tell you it's driving them crazy. Don't forget President Obama. They say he was a great president. Well, you can't be a great president when much of what he's done we've undone. And you can't be a great president when you leave 142 empty judgeships. I don't think any president's left any. These are very, very important things for a party. Different policies, different everything. You understand it better than anybody, the people in this room. Left us 142. First day in office, I said, ""How many judges do I have to appoint?"" ""Sir, you have 142."" I said, ""You have to be kidding. 140."" So I had a big headstart. But we have 142. But now we will have, I think, in excess, by the time we finish, in excess of 300, including Court of Appeals. And of course, two very exceptional Supreme Court justices. So good, really good. And remember this in terms of get out the vote. The next president, I think, could have anywhere from two to four to maybe even five, just based on statistics, statistically, Supreme Court justices to pick. Think of that. I've had two. Some presidents have had none because you generally pick them young and they last a long time, right? They can last a long time. But we could have two to three to four, maybe even to five. It's probably a stretch, but four isn't a stretch at all. That would mean that the entire balance of the court doesn't just shift, it becomes dominant. So if we don't win, which we don't want to think about, we have to think positively, and the polls today, Rasmussen, 51%. And they were the ones that got it right last time, them and a few others. 51%. They don't want to show those. They only want to show those polls, not likely voters, registered voters. What does that mean? Many are dead. Many have switched their party affiliations. Registered, they don't show likely. But you see some of these polls where they interview many more Democrats than Republicans. And they have to, I guess, by law, they interviewed. But many more. And they don't go likely. Why don't they do likely voters? Because I think they'd be very upset. I think they know they'd be very upset. Bottom line, we're doing very well. We have the biggest crowds. I think there's more enthusiasm now for this election than there was even, it's record enthusiasm, by the way, record setting enthusiasm right now, it's more now than we had even four years ago.

"But if you look at the Obama Administration, ISIS was rampaging all over. I've defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister of Iraq in my office and he made a statement. He said, ""Sir, I want to thank you. You have defeated ISIS."" I said, ""Wait a minute. You say that. Nobody ever says that. Those people back there don't say it. What do you mean by that?"" He said, ""You."" I said, ""Do you mean Obama? Do you mean the United States?"" ""Sir, Obama, it was a disaster. When you took over ISIS was in 30% of our country. You came in and you defeated."" I said, ""Will you please go public with that?"" So he said, ""I would,"" he would. But it's true. I mean, we defeated 100% of the caliphate and we turned it all around. We rebuilt the United States military, $2.5 trillion. We have a brand new beautiful military. And as I said with Israel, we got out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, which was such a horrible thing for Israel. But I asked a friend of mine, who's a big fan of Israel, I said, ""So what was the best? Golan Heights, Jerusalem capital? What was more important of the two?"" Golan Heights, which they've been working on for 52 years, recognition of Golan Heights for Israel. 52 years, planes would fly in. They'd have summits every year or two, planes would fly in. They'd talk, they'd talk and keep talking. Two days later, the planes would fly out. Then they'd meet two years later. 52 years, they went through that. I got it done immediately. I said, ""Which is more important, Golan Heights or Jerusalem Capitol?"" I said, ""Neither."" I said, ""What do you mean neither?"" He said, ""The most important is when you withdrew from that horrible and very dangerous Iran Nuclear Deal. That was the greatest thing you did for Israel."" It's very interesting. And I said, ""I agree."" I actually said, ""I agree."" We imposed the toughest ever US sanctions in Iran. And this week we invoked the snapback provisions to restore virtually all of the previously suspended UN sanctions. We snapped it back. It's a good term. The founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, is dead. We killed him. And the world's top terrorist, probably over 50 years the top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead.

Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, ""General, I've got myself a problem, general."" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, ""General, I have a problem,"" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, ""There's no way."" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, ""General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.""",,
"It's true. So I said, ""Is there like something else around?"" ""Sir, the ramp is ready to go."" ""Grab me sir, grab me."" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, ""That will be a story too."" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really ... It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, ""General, get ready because I may grab you so fast."" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? ""I don't want that, general."" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, ""Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, ""General, I'm sorry,"" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, ""Here was the number one trending story.""",,
"If Biden is elected, he will surrender your country to these mobsters 100%. Your 401(k)s, by the way, look at how we're doing in the stock market. Just set another record with NASDAQ. NASDAQ. Your 401(k)s and money itself will be worthless. Your 401(k)s are doing very well unless I don't want to say ... If you were stupid I'd say, ""Don't sell. Don't sell. It went down."" But we got it back up, and now NASDAQ, think of it. NASDAQ just set a record and I think you're going to see a lot of records, and next year, if we don't do anything stupid on November 3, you are going to have the greatest economic year we've ever had. That will be next year. If the Democrats gain power, than the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control. Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left, and he's not radical left. I don't think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left, but he's controlled by the radical left, and now he's really controlled. His campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis. They bailed them out, they put up a lot of money to bail them out, the rioters, the looters and they were, they were the arsonists. They'll say, ""Oh, it's terrible what he says about the people of our nation."" Maybe some of them aren't even from our nation. The leftists try to do everything they can to stop us. Every hour of every day, including even violence and mayhem, they'll do anything they can to stop us. Look what happened tonight. Look at what happened tonight. Law enforcement said, ""Sir, they can't be outside. It's too dangerous."" We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city. The mayor and the governor did a great job, but they were very violent people. Our people are not nearly as violent, but if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side. Because I know our people. I know our people, but we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation. What they did tonight, I saw it on television coming in on Air Force One. One thing about Air Force One, we got plenty of televisions. We have televisions in closets. You open up the closet, got a television. We got a lot of televisions. It's a great plane. Great everything. By the way, we ordered new ones. No president wanted to do it. They thought it was luxurious [inaudible 00",,
"So the deal was made and it was made for a lot of money. I think it was $5.7 or $5.6 billion. Now in all fairness, it's two planes and there's a lot of stuff in those planes I won't talk to you about. So I told Boeing, the head of Boeing, they said, ""Sir, please, we'd like to get started on the planes,"" I said, ""I do too, but I'm not paying $5.6 billion, and I'm not paying $4.6 billion."" I said, "" It has to have a three on the front of it."" That's a hell of a lot of money too, but it is a rather complex situation. They said, ""No way."" No way. This was before Boeing had problems by the way, but Boeing is coming back. They're coming back. Greatest company of the world and that's their big problem. It had a couple of problems that didn't work out. That was terrible, but the greatest. I think before that, it was the greatest company in the world. It made up a quarter, one quarter of a point, of our GDP. Think how big that is, one company. It was an unbelievable machine and then they made a plane and they did some foolish things and a terrible thing happened and all of a sudden they've gone through hell but you know what? They're coming back, we're ready to help them if they need it but they're coming back in the coming [inaudible 00",,
"By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, ""$250 million?"" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, ""Oh, he exaggerates."" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great ... I say, ""General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general."" ""Why sir?"" ""Because I don't want to pay 250."" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job.",,
"Somebody two days ago said, ""Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you."" I said, ""Yeah, why do you call them the elite,"" I said, ""why?"" ""Well, they're not elite."" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger.",,

You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. ""Sir, we've just taken 100%."" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, ""In God we trust."" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.",,

In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges including court of appeals judges. Because President Obama did us a great favor when I came in, I said, ""I assume I have no judges to appoint."" No sir, you have 138 judges. 138? Didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138, now we're up to 180. I just signed my 150th federal judge, and court of appeals judge, and we already have two great Supreme Court justices, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Great, great men. So think of that. You know, you come in, and I've always heard the most important thing a president does, I disagree with this by the way, but that's okay. I disagree with a lot of things. Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right? But have you listened to the so-called Washington elite, now why are they elite? We do better than they do, we're smarter than them. We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite. That means you're the super elite. I've always take offense when somebody said, ""President Trump is tired of listening to the elite."" I said, ""No, no, I'm more elite than them."" Right? I think so. I mean, if we go by the old standards, better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going, and then I decide to run for president. And I'll be honest, while we have to put up with these people, and others are, it's incredible. But it's the greatest single decision I've ever made, because our country is turning around so rapidly. I could not be happier, despite what they put us all through. Could not be happier. After years of building up other countries, we're finally building up our country. Isn't that nice? It's time to finally take care of our own. And we're all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic, which is horrible. And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades. 30 years.",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-mexico-rally-transcript-full-speech-transcript,"Donald Trump held a campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico on September 16, 2019 where he made a pitch to latino voters for his 2020 campaign.

They have it, but the commission your commissioners wrote, I quote, ""Our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing."" This is your commissioners writing to us in Washington. Our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens, you, and our existing homeless populations, many of whom are American veterans, right? So, Democrats put illegal aliens before American citizens. Republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first. I'm sorry. That includes millions of hardworking, lawful immigrants who waited in line, followed the rules, and came into our country legally. And among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are Hispanic Americans who obey our laws, pay their taxes, contribute to our communities and play by the rules, and they're the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it.

They love him. We won Wisconsin. They like him and Wisconsin, and a lot of the farm states, and they targeted. The farmers came to see me and they said, ""Sir, you have to do what's right."" When the fake news would interview farmers, the farmers would say, ""No, no, President Trump is doing the right thing. It should have been done years ago. Should've been done years and years ago."" But you couldn't have made it because there was too much money, $16 billion. So, what I did is I put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from China, $250 billion, and then more tariffs on things beyond the $250 billion market. We took in billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. We still are, and then what happened? When I heard about the farmers and I saw the farmers, they were in the White House.

We're waiting in line for two weeks, for four weeks, for seven weeks."" Honestly people were waiting in line, they weren't very sick, they were terminally ill, truthfully, before they saw a doctor. By the time they got to the doctor. So I came up with this incredible plan. Only I could think of this. I said, ""Here's what you do ... Here's what you do, if somebody can't get a doctor quickly,"" because we have great doctors at the VA. They don't get enough credit. ""If you can't get to a doctor quickly you go outside, you go locally, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself all better."" Right?",,

He's going to lock it up. If one guy walks up and says, ""Sir, I think we should close up our country."" ""Okay, that sounds good to me.""

We imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products, saving countless timber jobs all across your state, and you know exactly what I'm talking about. You were taken advantage of by stupid US policy. Canada was taking advantage of this country. Not anymore. If Biden and the crew get in, the radical left will bring timber production to a total halt.
